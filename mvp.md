All of the competitors mentioned in competitors.md have similar "Basic" tears.

Below is HomeLets example, which is fairly representative:

* Complete credit check, including adverse history such as CCJs and bankruptcy
* Background search on previous names, addresses and aliases
* Financial sanctions check
* Assurance that their bank account is genuine
* ~~Cross referencing against HomeLetâ€™s Default Database~~

This is the minimum that could be done to be able to say that Stabled provides a competative standard of reference. Insurance of rental income and other competitor features could be discussed later.
